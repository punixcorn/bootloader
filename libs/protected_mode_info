Answer | fast Model

To enter protected mode, we need to perform the following steps:

    Set up the Global Descriptor Table (GDT):
        The GDT is a data structure used by the CPU to manage memory access in protected mode.
        We need to define the segment descriptors for code and data segments in the GDT.
        The GDT should be loaded into memory at a specific address and its location should be pointed to by the GDTR register.

    Set up the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT):
        The IDT is a data structure used by the CPU to manage interrupts in protected mode.
        We need to reserve memory for the IDT and fill it with zeroes.
        We then need to tell the CPU where the IDT is located by using the IDTR register.

    Load the address of the GDT into the GDTR register:
        We use the lgdt instruction to load the address of the GDT into the GDTR register.
    Load the address of the IDT into the IDTR register:
        We use the lidt instruction to load the address of the IDT into the IDTR register.
    Enable protected mode:
        We set the 0th bit of the control register 0 (CR0) to 1 to enable protected mode.
        We then jump to a code segment descriptor in the GDT to enter protected mode.

Here's some sample code to set up the GDT, IDT, and enter protected mode:

; Set up the GDT
gdt:
    ; Null descriptor
    dd 0
    dd 0
    
    ; Code segment descriptor
    dw 0xFFFF ; Limit
    dw 0x0 ; Base
    db 0x0 ; Base
    db 0x9A ; Access byte
    db 0xCF ; Granularity byte
    db 0x0 ; Base
    
    ; Data segment descriptor
    dw 0xFFFF ; Limit
    dw 0x0 ; Base
    db 0x0 ; Base
    db 0x92 ; Access byte
    db 0xCF ; Granularity byte
    db 0x0 ; Base
    
gdt_size:
    dw $ - gdt - 1
gdt_ptr:
    dd gdt_size
    dd gdt
    
; Set up the IDT
idt:
    times 256 dw 0
idt_ptr:
    dw 256 * 8 - 1
    dd idt
    
load_gdt:
    lgdt [gdt_ptr]
    mov eax, cr0
    or eax, 0x1
    mov cr0, eax
    
load_idt:
    lidt [idt_ptr]
    
    ; Jump to code segment descriptor in GDT to enter protected mode
    jmp 0x08:protected_mode_entry
    
protected_mode_entry:
    ; Code to execute in protected mode
